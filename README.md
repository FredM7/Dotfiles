#### Fred's Dotfiles

## Stow

I use GNU Stow to manage my dotfiles.

If you don't have it already, install it. I use Arch, BTW.

```
sudo pacman -Sy stow
```

Once it is installed, it's as simple as running this inside the `Dotfiles` direcotry.

```
stow .
```

## Git

Obviously I also use `git` to store my files. If you don't already have it installed, run this:

```
sudo pacman -Sy git
```
